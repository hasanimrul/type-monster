            <span class="fw-bold text-light">Global scope:</span> Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks.

        <h3 class="text-light">Q3:- How does javascript event loop works?</h3>
        <h4 class="fw-bold text-light ">Answer:-</h4>
        <h5 class="ms-5 text-secondary">
            <span class="fw-bold text-light">Event Loop:</span> The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.

            =>When a variable is declared or initialized but no value is assigned to it, JavaScript automatically displays undefined. <br>
            => When we try accessing values in an array that doesn’t exist, it will throw undefined. <br>
